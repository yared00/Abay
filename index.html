  <p style="color:white";> The Grand Ethiopian renaissance dam!
Geopolitical injustice has barred the Ethiopia from using its water resources to generate electricity! Ethiopia contributes about 86% of the Nile water flowing to sudan and egypt.</p>
<p style="color:white";> The 1959 Colonial-era treaty brokered by Britain gave Egypt and Sudan the lion’s share of the water(Egypt 75%| Sudan 25%| Ethiopia 0%). Ethiopia deserves its fair share of the Nile River to lift its people out of poverty. 60% of Ethiopian’s live without electricity. The world Bank had refused to finance the GERD under pressure from Egypt and its allies. Now, the GERD construction is near completion, solely financed by the people of Ethiopia. The dam will generate 6,000 megawatts of electricity for domestic use and the region’s benefit. </p> <p style="color:white";>There is no force that prevents us from completing the Grand Renaissance Dam. Ethiopia has No desire to harm Egypt or Sudan by building the dam.The GERD is a hydro project and will not consume water. Sudan has fully supported the project. In 1999, Ethiopia and the nine upstream countries launched the Nile Basin Initiative Equitably to share the Nile water.Egypt refused to join, demanding a veto over all the other countries. Uganda’s President Museveni, once said, “No African wants to hurt Egypt. However, Egypt can’t continue to hurt Black Africa.” It’s like, I want the milk but, I don’t care about the cow. Miss-leading and undermining Ethiopia’s position doesn’t help, understanding and mutual respect will. A disagreement between two African countries should be resolved by Africans, Not by the Arab League, Europe, or the United States.</p>
